## adaptive iteratively reweighted Penalized Least Squares (airPLS)

Baseline drift always blurs or even swamps signals and deteriorates analytical results, particularly in multivariate analysis. It is necessary to correct baseline drift to perform further data analysis. Simple or modified polynomial fitting has been found to be effective in some extent. However, this method requires user intervention and prone to variability especially in low signal-to-noise ratio environments. The proposed adaptive iteratively reweighted Penalized Least Squares (airPLS) algorithm doesn't require any user intervention and prior information, such as detected peaks. It iteratively changes weights of sum squares errors (SSE) between the fitted baseline and original signals, and the weights of SSE are obtained adaptively using between previously fitted baseline and original signals. This baseline estimator is general, fast and flexible in fitting baseline.

At every iteration, the fitting weights on the regions with peaks are reduced to identify the baseline only.

7.  The iterative convolution algorithm, on the other hand, iteratively fits a polynomial function in such a way that, for each iteration, the values of all the data points that are above the polynomial are replaced with the value of the polynomial itself; the algorithm stops when the change between two consecutive iterations is smaller than a chosen threshold or when the set number of iterations is reached

# concepts

- least squares is fitting technique
- sliding window
- Chemometric methods for baseline correction can be
  subdivided into five categories: full-matrix methods, frequency
  filtering, manual estimation, derivative preprocessing, and
  polynomial fitting.

# Thoughts

1.  samples across a single run should be analyzed together right?

Samples across spectra, metadata, > mzML.

## Notes

- There seem to be a few categories (referencing qian2017)
  - polynomial fitting (A)
  - small window moving average (A)
  - adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares (SA)
  - wavelet (SA)
  - automated vs semi-automated
- What are one way vs two way corrections?

categories:

- orthogonal basis (OB),
- fuzzy optimal associative memory (FOAM),
- polynomial fitting (PF) wang 2014
